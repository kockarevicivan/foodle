# foodle
Practice project - food ordering application written in MERN stack.

Feature branch workflow is used (learn more here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow): 

*master* is a protected branch that should only be used for releases.

*develop* This is a main development branch that should be a live source-of-truth for the code.

*feature/...* Feature branches should be created for separate features, and deleted afterwards

Branches should be rebased into each other and while working on a single branch, also rebase your commits.
